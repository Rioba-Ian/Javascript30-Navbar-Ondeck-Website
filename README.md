### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS for CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### My approach

The first thing was to design my sass reusable components and a sass file structure.
After that I would nest styles inside each other. I did the body and then the navbar then finished with the main section. The main and navbar are their own sass css components. 

#### Future development 
I would like to do more of sass and use more functionilities including mixins, functions and some other crazy stuff. Being the first time using sass, it was quite an uphill to learn how to leverage the power of sass.
